** はじめに
自然言語処理するにあたって、Web収集した文書についてHTML特殊文字が邪魔したので、それを含めたストップリストを作成した．((そもそもパースしろよっていうツッコミはあるが，もしかしたらニーズがあるかも知れないのでここに残す．))

** 参考サイト
このストップワードは，以下サイトのものを組み合わせた．
1. http://jmlr.org/papers/volume5/lewis04a/a11-smart-stop-list/english.stop
2. http://pst.co.jp/powersoft/html/index.php?f=3401
具体的な組み合わせ作業は次の通り．
*** 組み合わせ作業メモ
2.のHTML特殊文字一覧ページから、&と;に囲まれた文字列を取得する．((例えば$amp;のamp))
>|javascript|
let xpaths = ["/html/body/div/div/div[3]/table/tbody/tr", 
              "/html/body/div/div/div[4]/table/tbody/tr"];
for(let j=0; j<xpaths.length; j++) {
  let nodes = document.evaluate(xpaths[j],document,null,7,null);
  for(let i=0; i<nodes.snapshotLength; i++) {
    let entity = nodes.snapshotItem(i).childNodes[1].innerHTML.match(/\&amp\;([a-zA-Z]+)\;/);
    if(entity && entity[1]){
      console.log(entity[1]);
    }
  }
}
